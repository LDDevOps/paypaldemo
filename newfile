1. Number of branches = WE maintain 3 branches
  dev branch    ---> develoment Environment
  stage branch  ---> Testing/QA/UAT Environment
  master branch ---> PRODUCTION 
    feature 
    bug_fixed 

2. Branch security = 
   All commits in the master branch must go through PR 

3. Switching branches =  working tree should be clean 
    DevOps Engineer [dev branch / master--bugfixed]
    If neccesary backup incomplete tasks before switching  
      git stash command  
4. git rebase over git merge
5. review changes [git diff] before merging
6. Use PR before committing to the master branch 
7. avoid merge conflicts
